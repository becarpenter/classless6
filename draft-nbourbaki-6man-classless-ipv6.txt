Abstract

   Over the history of IPv6, various classful address models have been
   proposed, particularly Top-Level Aggregation (TLA) and Next-Level
   Aggregation(NLA) Identifiers.  They have all proved to be mistakes.
   The last remnant is a rigid boundary at /64.  This document removes
   that rigidity as far as routing is concerned.

1.  Introduction

   Over the history of IPv6, various classful address models have been
   proposed, particularly Top-Level Aggregation (TLA) and Next-Level
   Aggregation(NLA) Identifiers.  They have all proved to be mistakes.
   For example, TLA and NLA were obsoleted by [RFC3587].  The last
   remnant is a rigid boundary at /64.  This document removes that
   rigidity as far as routing is concerned.

2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands the history of classful
   addressing in IPv4 and why it was abolished [RFC4632].  Of course,
   the acute need to conserve address space that forced the adoption of
   classless addressing for IPv4 does not apply to IPv6; but the
   arguments for operational flexibility in address allocation remain
   compelling.

   It is also assumed that the reader understands IPv6, [RFC2460], IP
   Version 6 Addressing Architecture, see [RFC4291], and the proposed
   changes to [RFC4291], see [I-D.hinden-6man-rfc2464bis].

   NOTE: do we mean 4291bis (currently moribund) or 2464bis?

   An important recent development in IPv6 is that for host computers on
   local area networks, the way in which interface identifiers are
   formed is no longer bound to layer 2 addresses (MAC addresses)
   [RFC7217].  We can therefore appreciate that their length, previously
   fixed at 64 bits [RFC7136], is in fact a free parameter as stated in
   [RFC4862].

Internet-Draft              IPv6 is Classless                 April 2017


3.  Background

   Some confusion has been caused by the IP Version 6 Addressing
   Architecture, [RFC4291], and the proposed changes in
   [I-D.hinden-6man-rfc2464bis] with respect to allowed maximum prefix
   lengths and the minimum host part (sometimes known as interface
   identifier) on a link.

   Meanwhile, link prefixes of varied lengths, /127, /126, /124, /120,
   ... /64 have been successfully deployed for many years.  Having the
   formal specification be unclear risks potential mis-implementation by
   the naive, which could result in operational disasters.

4.  A simple Statement

   To state it simply, IPv6 unicast routing is based on prefixes of any
   valid length up to 128 except for links where an Internet Standard
   such as, for example, Stateless Address AutoConfiguration [RFC4862],
   or Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-Router Links [RFC6164] is in
   use.

5.  Notes and Recommendations

   For historical reasons, when a prefix is needed on a link, barring
   other considerations, a /64 is traditional [RFC7136].

   The length of the prefix identifier in Stateless Address
   AutoConfiguration, [RFC4862] is a parameter; its length needs to be
   sufficient for effective randomization for privacy reasons.  For
   example, a /48 might be sufficient.  But operationally we recommend,
   barring strong considerations to the contrary, using 64-bits for
   SLAAC in order not to discover bugs where 64-bits was hard-coded, and
   to favor portability of devices and operating systems.

   None the less, there is no reason in theory why an IPv6 node should
   not operate with different interface identfier lengths on different
   physical interfaces.  Thus a correct implementation of SLAAC must in
   fact allow for any length of prefix, with the value being
   parameterised per interface.

   NOTE: should we comment on the fact that at least Linux and Windows
   seem to assume that the default prefix is /64 in the management CLI?

6.  Security Considerations

   This document has no known security impact, assuming that user
   devices use an unpredictable interface identifier [RFC7721] for
   privacy.
