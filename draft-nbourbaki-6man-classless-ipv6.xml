  <abstract>

    <t>Over the history of IPv6, there have been many classful address
    models; TLA and NLA being outstanding examples.  They have all been
    shown to be mistakes.  The last remaining is a magic boundary at
    /64.  This document removes that last bit of useless magic.</t>

  <section anchor="reading" title="Suggested Reading">

    <t>It is assumed that the reader understands IPv6, <xref
    target="RFC2460"/>, IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture, see <xref
    target="RFC4291"/>, and the proposed changes to <xref
    target="RFC4291"/>, see <xref
    target="I-D.hinden-6man-rfc2464bis"/>.</t>

  <section anchor="background" title="Background">

<!--
    <t>To quote Lorenzo Colitti in the working group meeting at IETF 98,
    "Just because this is being elevated to full standard does not mean
    it can not be changed tomorrow."  Tomorrow is here.</t>
-->

    <t>Some confusion has been caused by the IP Version 6 Addressing
    Architecture, <xref target="RFC4291"/>, and the proposed changes in
    <xref target="I-D.hinden-6man-rfc2464bis"/> with respect to allowed
    maximum prefix lengths and the minimum host part on a link.</t>
    
    <t>In the meantime, link prefixes of varied lengths, /127, /126,
    /124, /120, ... /64 have been successfully deployed for many years.
    Having the formal specification be unclear risks potential
    mis-implementation by the naive, which could result in operational
    disasters.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="simple" title="A simple Statement">

    <t>To state it simply, IPv6 unicast routing is based on prefixes of
    any valid length up to 128 except for links where an Internet
    Standard such as Stateless Address Configuration <xref
    target="RFC4862"/>, or Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-Router
    Links <xref target="RFC6164"/> is in use.</t>

    </section>

  <section anchor="notes" title="Notes and Recommendations">

    <t>For historical reasons, when a prefix is needed on a link,
    barring other considerations, a /64 is traditional.</t>

    <t>The length of the prefix identifier in Stateless Address
    Configuration, <xref target="RFC4862"/> is a parameter; its length
    needs to be sufficient for effective randomization for privacy
    reasons.  For example, a /48 would be sufficient.  But we recommend,
    barring strong considerations to the contrary, using 64-bits for
    SLAAC in order not to discover where 64-bits was hard-coded.</t>
